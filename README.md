## SceneBox Techinal Assignment

üé• Cinema is a website that helps users find movies by movie title.

There are **two branches**.

The First branch **_basic-design_** is for the app with basic design using Styled-components only.

The **_main branch(custom-design)_** is built with my custom design using CSS and Styled-components.

**Part 1Ô∏è‚É£**

- Use OMDB APIs to get the data of movies
- Update input value in real-time
- Show error message below the search box for the user
- Use Axios to make HTTP requests

**Part 2Ô∏è‚É£**

- Make modal components without UI library

**Part 3Ô∏è‚É£**

- Show the time that the user has spent on the app using session storage
  (If the user wants to keep the login time after the refresh, you can use local storage data to save data with a cookie)

**Bonus ‚ú®**

- Users can switch the movie in the modal box

üìö The reason for using Typescript instead of javascript for a small-scale application is that I recently learned Typescript, so I wanted to improve and study at the same time.
